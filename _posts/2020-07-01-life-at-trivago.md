On September 4th 2018, at exactly 11:25 EST I landed in Leipzig, Germany with a one way ticket I had purchased. I came to Germany for one reason, to join the trivago team in Leipzig to help achieve the mission and vision of trivago express booking.{% sidenote 'note-on-express-booking' 'A trivago product that allow OTAS and Hotel Chains expand their businesses to new markets and increase conversation while promoting their brand and competing with big players with ease.' %} 

## Relocating to Germany

When moving to a new country because of employment, two things that can really stress you out is **Visa and Accommodation**. Lucky for me, the good folks at trivago had both sorted out. The people and office management team were very helpful with the visa process and had a flat prepared for you to stay until you get your own place with the added advantage that you didn't have to pay a dime.{% sidenote 'pay-for-flat' 'I think this changed a year after I joined and you had to pay a penny and could only stay there for up to three months.' %}

If you are moving to a non English-speaking locale like Germany, then you had one more thing to worry about - **Language**. A huge consolation was that Germany is filled with lots of internationals that could speak English fluently. At the same time, key offices where you need to do compulsory registration had only German-speaking employees. I didn't have to worry so much as the folks in people and office management would offer to go with you for this registration and translate documents for you when needed. 

In retrospect, my relocation was smooth without stress, and I have the people and office management folks to thank for that, with personal gratitude to Sören Ille and Cinthia Solorio you guys ROCK!!!

## My First Impression

Before I came to Germany, my general knowledge about Germany was zero to none. The only things I knew was mostly about WWII, Mercedes-benz etc. I, however, knew that it was one of the most powerful countries in the world, as a result, I made some assumptions. One of the assumptions almost got me stranded at the Leipzig airport on arrival. 

Hear me out, I come from a developing country where cashless was a thing like no one moved around with cash, all you needed was your debit card as almost all small business had POS machines, and you could always pay with your debit card. 

I came to Germany with the assumption that, if this was possible in Nigeria, then why travel to a country like Germany with cash. So, I came with zero cash, solely dependent on my debit card. I checked myself out of the Leipzig airport with my backpack and one big hand luggage, ready to take a taxi and head of to the address that had been given to me. 

{% marginfigure 'touch-down-leipzig-margin' 'assets/img/posts/life-at-trivago/touch-down-leipzig.jpg' '*Quick shot* from my window seat few seconds before landing at the **Leipzig / Halle Airport**.' %}

The first thing I did was connect to the Airport WI-FI, launched the Uber app on my phone and that was when I saw the notice, "Unfortunately, Uber is not available in your area.". I was like impossible, it must be my internet. I disconnected and connected back hoping that would fix something, after multiple tries I decided to ask for help, turned out Uber doesn't work here.
 
 I also couldn't use the local taxi as the only accepted payment method was cash. To cut the long story short, my saving grace was a young fella who noticed I had been roaming about the airport for some time, he walked up to me and spoke in English, "Are you having any sort difficulties?" I told him the story, and he said my card won't work with the ATM either. 
 
 Luckily I had saved up some dollars on my Paypal. So, I asked him, do you have a Paypal account? He answered yes asking me the same, I responded with yes, so he suggested I send him $100, so he could then give me the cash equivalent in Euros. This was how I was able to take the local taxi. I think I spent roughly 2 hours at the airport after checking out.

## The Check-in Week

As a newbie in trivago, you undergo a 5-day onboarding program hence the name *Check-in Week*. The check-in week takes place at the company campus in Dusseldorf, Germany and the goal was to create a welcoming, insightful and challenging start for the newbies, ensuring you understand the business, connect with the companies culture and feel empowered to make an impact. 

**<u>Day 1</u>**

On the first day, you get a general overview about the trivago from the business model -> core values -> organisational structure. You meet a lot of people and browse around the beautiful campus. You end the day by getting your work laptop, so you can set up your email, slack and other communication tools used by the company.

**<u>Day 2 - 4</u>**

On the second day, you should now have you laptop amd also set up your work mail. Once you log into your email, there are JIRA tasks already waiting for you. This task involves simple things like updating your info in Workday, going to wage and accounting to get your salary account all sorted, so you can get paid at the end of the month. Time slots have already been set aside for this task, so you can still participate in the core check-in week activities. 

You are also divided into groups for group activities and case studies. A representative from each pillar/department in the organisational structure comes in to discuss what they do in their pillar, the pillar structure and how what they do affects the general trivago ecosystem. This is also an opportunity for you to see how your job function ties into the trivago ecosystem. Your group is then given a case studies to show your understanding of the pillar function. 

Some case studies were fun while some were challenging. I personally enjoyed the marketing case study. Some groups stayed at the campus till 9PM to show you how challenging some of this case studies were.

**<u>Day 5</u>**

That last day is what I like to call *fun day*. Each group was given a tablet. The tablet had a game we had to play which involves walking around the city of Dusseldorf finding items and locations, taking picture of landmarks, meeting at specific locations at specific times etc. Each achievement had a score and there was a prize for the winning team. Unfortunately my team didn't win. We ended the day at a local pub that brews its own beer. trivago had paid for us all to drink as much as we can. We drank, shared our respective experiences with regard to the check-in week, shared contact details and went our separate ways. 

## The Team

I would never forget my first day at the Leipzig office after the check-in week. The temporary flat was in the same building as the office, so I basically took the elevator down to work. After getting information overload from the check-in week, I was ready to jump into work mode. I came into the office and went straight to office management. Office management gave me a little tour of the office and handed me over to my manager. 

I had a short meeting with my manager as he showed me a confluence page that had been prepared outlining things to do for the week, so I could get acquainted with the office, product and the team. We concluded the meeting, and he showed me where I would be seating. 

{% maincolumn 'assets/img/posts/life-at-trivago/desk-decoration-first-day.jpg' 'My first day at the Leipzig office with my desk decorated with a welcome card.' %}

The team had this culture of putting your country flag at the entrance of the office when a newbie joins. My desk had been decorated and there was a welcome card with little notes from every member of the team. I have never felt more welcome, and I instantly felt like I had known everyone for decades.

18 month down the line, and I must tell you this are some of the finest, smartest, kindest people I have ever worked with. I am really happy I had the opporunity to meet every single person at the Leipzig office and more importantly work closely with every member of the Express Booking team.

[trivago](https://company.trivago.com/) is a meta-search, the simplest way to think about trivago is "Google" but for hotels. As a user, you have chosen Austria to be your holiday destination, however choosing the perfect accommodation for your stay is always a problem because there is just so much variable to consider coupled with the fact that the same hotel room can have different prices across multiple OTA.{% sidenote 'ota-meaning' 'OTA is an acronym for *Online Travel Agency*.

## The Company

If you got here, then you most likely already know a lot about the trivago. Regardless there are few things I will love to highlight about the trivago. I don't know what you've heard about trivago, but take it from me "trivago is a good place to work." The salary might not be as competitive as what you are used to, but the company makes up for it with other benefits you likely don't get elsewhere. 

Few of those benefits includes unlimited vacations, tech get together, study/conference budget, trivago on tour, bi-weekly and monthly team events. Unfortunately, I only had the opportunity to experience one *Tech Get Together* and *trivago On Tour*. If you are interested, I will share a little details about both of them i the next two sections.

### Tech Get Together

trivago Tech Get Together is a unique internal tech conference that unites all our tech talents from across all pillars and locations to foster communication, trust and knowledge exchange. The 2019 edition had ~190 talks submitted and over 65 accepted after rigorous review and voting. 

The highlight for me was the fact that 98% of those talks were prepared and presented by trivago talents. We also had guest speakers from Expedia, HomeAway and HotelsCom. 

{% maincolumn 'assets/img/posts/life-at-trivago/rolf-open-remarks.jpg' 'Rolf Schrömgens - *trivago CEO in 2019* giving the opening remarks.' %}

The talks were categorised into *People/Team/Leadership*, *Programming languages & Techniques*, *Software & Applications*, *Mobile*, *Big Data & Data Science*, *Product*, *Infracstructure & Devops*, *Design UI/UX* and *Various* for talks that didn't really fit into the other categories. One interesting talk in the various category I clearly remember was **A beginners guide to engineering bread.** We were thought how to make your bread, and it was an interesting session.

My favorite talk was **Designing understandable data visualizations**, presented by Ana Risteska. Where she teaches how to use the power of visual attributes to communicate data without putting too much strain on the users brain. You can download the presentation [here](https://github.com/anarisris/presentations/blob/master/tech-get-together.pdf).

I really enjoyed all the session I attended and gained knowledge about things I didn't know before. I also had the opportunity to see and speak to engineers in other team especially those I work with on regular basis but, only see on Slack.

### trivago On Tour

At trivago, there are 4 core company events that happen every year, one of them is the trivago on tour which happens to be an annual trip for all trivago employees and frankly my favorite.
 
The activities and destination are guarded secrets, this means you wouldn't know where you were going until you got there. Before d-day, some employees would have spread all kinds of rumours and gossips about the activities only problem was, no one was going to validate any of those rumours, so we are left dreaming of where the journey might take us until we are already there.

Each trivago on tour has a different theme and destination, I missed the 2018 trivago on tour because of visa issues. The 2018 tour was in an old military base near Dusseldorf and the theme was about endurance and helping each other conquer obstacles and challenges during trying times by working together as one team. 

In 2019, the tour took us to Austria by train, and the theme was centered around #trust. trivago gave all employees the opportunity to shape the tour with whatever hidden talents they have. We also had other fun activities including short and long distance hike, fun games, parties and lots of alcohol. Below are some pictures I took in Austria.

I really enjoyed my time at trivago, and I will highly recommend, as in my opinion is one of the best place to work in Germany. trivago  is always hiring, feel free to check out their [career page](https://company.trivago.com/open-positions/) for open positions.
