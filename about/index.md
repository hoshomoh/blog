My name is *Oshomo Oforomeh* and I am an experienced software engineer with a Bsc in computer science. Worked as a Backend, Frontend and Fullstack Engineers across different sectors including Payment, E-commerce, Logistics, Marketing, Travel and Accommodation.

I have a good understanding of the current technology landscape and unlike many software engineers, I am also a product person. I like to have a full understanding of what I am working on and more importantly why I am working on it. Asking questions like: what value does this feature give to customers? How do we make profit and still keep our customers happy? How do we keep delivering value to customers while keeping their data safe and adhering to all GDPR directives?

I am currently not looking for any job opportunities at the moment as I am quite happy with my current role at
[Taxfix](https://taxfix.de/){:target="_blank"}. However, if you are a junior engineer, looking for a mentor, I might have some time to
spare, just reach out to me at [hello@oshomo.oforomeh.com](mailto:hello@oshomo.oforomeh.com){:target="_blank"}.
