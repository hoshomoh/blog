My name is *Oshomo Oforomeh* and I am an experienced software engineer with a Bsc in computer science. I have created software and used technology to solve problems for products in the following sectors; marketing, e-commerce, payment, logistics, travel and accommodation.

I have served in the capacity of a web developer, backend engineer, full-stack engineer and temporary team lead. And I have seen first-hand the different challenges and mistakes with how technological organization approach product development as well as improvement areas in how product teams use technology to solve customer needs for a product while shipping fast and not leaving behind technical dept.

With the above in mind, my interest lies in serving in the capacity of a software engineer(backend or full-stack) to solve engineering challenges while contributing to the organization's product mission and vision and have fun while doing it.
